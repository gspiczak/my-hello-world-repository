Let the journey begin...
I'm a physics/astrophysics professor, currently at the University of Wisconsin River Falls. 
I teach general astronomy, astrophysics, digital electronics, nuclear & particle physics, general physics for majors and non-majors, sustainable energy, and thermodynamics (so far, though not all of them each semester, thankfully).
I also mentor a multitude of student projects, essentially whatever it is that they're interested in, from astronomical spectroscopy or cosmic ray detection to high-altitude balloons, high-power rocketry and robotics.
